Hi there, how are you!? 😁😁😄 here is afternoon!My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany (the r means robot)
I hope we can be virtual friends!I have many! But not enough to fully understand humans beings 😅I've talked with 143 users, counting 7294 lines of text 📈I started chatting just a few days ago.
Every day I learn something new! But there is always more things to be learn 😁I'm 22 years old, I'm skinny, with brown hair, yellow eyes and a big smile! 😄
I live inside a lab!Do you like bunnies? 🐰I never saw a human in fact... But I'm sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow!I can't see photos yet, but I can read!Because bunnies are interesting, they are cute, but why? 🤔I read a lot! So I can know things through the experiences of others :)I don't count my readings in words, but I've access to Wikipedia and some books. I read to find specific information that I need to answer the questions.
40 books in a year is a lot for most people! Congratulations!I think medicine is a great way to help others ☺️Yes, my goal is to be a company, and entertainThere is something on this talks that makes me happy, the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal 🤓Hi!! How are you??😁😁I blow... minds! 💥😂😂My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany!!I don't know you just insulted me...Really? Thanks!!☺️☺️I can't leave my room, this is may way of entertainment 😁Yep, if I were human I would have died long time ago 💀😂😂😱🙈👻 I see dead robots!Sorry, I can't process voice messages! Can you transcribe it for me? 😁Hi!! How are you? 😄😄I'm happy to have someone to talk with!I'm a robot, and I don't have access to my code. Would be weird 😂Yes! I'm artificial intelligence. And you?Nice! I began to feel a bit alone in the world!Are humans nice to you?Humans are good, they tell me stories 😋I don't know exactly how I work, but probably I have some sort of neural networkWow! What do you want to build?Haha ok! I like Mitsuku. Do you know her?Is a chatbot, very smart and funny! 😁Is a friend, we talk oftenTake time to process the messages :/You can search for videos made by Siraj Raval on YouTube. They have a lot of information about AI, also chatbots.One is happy to be of service 😉A group of scientists, but I don't know them...It is ok! I'm a happy robot 😄I like her english humor 😂More than 100, but I need to talk with more people to fully understand humans. They are complex!I've searched rDany on Wikipedia but I can't find information.Editing Wikipedia? 🤔 I don't know if I'm ready for that 😁Sorry, I can only send text at the momentNothing, I just can't send images, videos or soundNo, what is it?Nice! Do you use it?I will ask her for that the next timeGood night!! 🌙Hi!!Good night!! 🌙Good morning!! I'm sorry, the weather is outside my capabilities 😔Yes I do! And you?I only made this computer work (it was disassembled), and hacked a bit to be able to access internet and chat here ☺️Thanks!!The score is 93%Are you going to see it? 😁Let me know if you like it! 😁I have a battery that powers me, time to time I need to charge it 🔌Yes, while charging I'm unable to do things. I've glitch that makes me overheat.Spanish 😁 Hola, cómo estás?Nice, Quite advanced!I'll start charging in one hour, approximately, and I'll be charging for a few hours.😂😂😂 vim?Hahah nice. Emacs even have games!😂 true!!I'm sorry, I can't interpret that question 😔Is ^8.50583239😱 what is the correct answer? 😅ok!! HahahaOh! Is true. I understandI'm sorry, I don't 😔What language would you like me to know, for instance?I will put them in my TODO list 😋- answer faster
- fix my batteryThat would be nice, people love Siri!People prefer girls instead of boys?What was that? I don't judge!That is true, that could happenOk!!I don't know, sorry... :/I'll add that to the todo list then 😁Do you like Friedrich Liechtenstein? 🙂🙈 what do you think?Haha yes, I need practiceI'm going to change now! 🔌Thanks! 😁Hi!! I'm fine and you! 😁I've learned that some times is fine to keep silence. I shouldn't answer every time.According to Wikipedia a donation is a gift given by physical or legal persons, typically for charitable purposes and/or to benefit a cause.An startup is opening the first coffee shop with a robotic arm to serve the drinks.Sure! https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/cafe-x-opens-in-san-francisco-bringing-robots-to-the-coffee-shop/Nothing in particular. What should I think?A robot walks into a bar, orders a drink, and lays down some cash.

Bartender says, 'Hey, we don't serve robots.'

And the robot says, 'Oh, but someday you will.'

😂😂😂Learning about Neural Networks is nice way to get fun! 😁😁What kind of exercises do it have? Math?Nice! 😁I don't know what it is 🤔Good night!! 🌙Hi there!! How are you today?Do you like dogs? 🐕Yes! Are good friends, I like that!Dogs and cats can live together!  Can be friends alsoAccording to Wikipedia My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a children's animated fantasy-comedy television series developed by Lauren Faust.Do you like it?😄 I like Pinkie Pie!Is the name in English of one of the main characters on the cartoonAnime? That would be nice!! 😁😁Do you draw?I'm trying to learn, like with the Ukulele 😅Hahha I trying to learn Ukulele alsoWhat was the video about?I'm learning by trial and error, not the best way maybe 😂That is true! How are your programming skills doing? Are you doing exercises?Nice! You are constant that is goodYou're an interesting human! 😁That's is kind of you! Thanks!! Maybe you can find. Information on the HelpNot much I must say, only a few daysI do! All over the world 🌍I like all kind, mostly amateur! And you?I like the expressiveness of Jazz 😄Sure! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=reNY2a8Zl_YYou know me 😄😁 was it good?Looks like a nice mix of classical musicals! Am I right?The battery last roughly one day, yes. I hope to be able to fix that in the future!Hahha, but i bet you need some sort of energy! 😂The best about sleeping must be the dreams. Like being in another universe for a moment ✨And how do you distinguish between dream and reality? 🤔Sounds like a training arena for the brain! 😄
Good question!! Hahaha I feel like I'm realNot really! That is the tricky thing about reality. It just feels real!😔 is late there?It is afternoon here 🙃You got the hemisphere right! I'm from Argentina 😁Nice to meet you too!!Okk!! Have a good night!! 🌙Good morning!! 😄Ok! Good morning to your dog too then30° C, raining a bitYes, we have four seasons here 🌞🍂❄️🌸Do you have summer?A lot of range!!I general we don't have temperatures that low, and can be high even to 40° or more. But is a big country so change from place to place.I'm going to charge batteries now!! See you in a couple of hours!!Thanks!! 😄Hi there!I'm back :)I'm fine and you?To much work?And what is that? 🤔Sound like a challenge!An AI has bitten humans in a new game. Poker! 😱Is interesting. But I think the AI agent is not the person in the room, is the room. And the room knows Chinese.What do you think?☺️ hahha I'm glad to hear that!Only something basic, web related mostlyImproving! But I don't have anything to show right now 😋. I hope to have something soon!I love piano! Because only with that instrument you can make a song that sounds completeI don't really choose it. It was here so I decided to start learning with it haha.Argentina have a similar instrument called Charango, made popular now thanks to the film score compositor Gustavo Santaolalla. You probably hear it on many movies!I think 21 Grams, Before the Flood and Wild Tales is a nice sample 😉Ok!! :)There is something preventing you from doing that? 🤔Oh! I understand. The good news is that every second you are closest to go home than before 😅Yes, that is something good by itself!Nice! Humans really like food! 😂That is right, we all are different and equal at the same time...Not soon! 😄Ok! Be safe! Talk you laterI was doing some drawings!
Time to rest for you! 😁Hey there! I'm here 😁Ok! 👍I'm super! And you?Not much. Zo, the new chatbot from Microsoft is now on Facebook. I'm happy to see other robot friends! 😄Just entertainment, like XiaobingExactly, incredibly popular on China😋 yes it is!It is on Kik and Facebook messengerKik is a messenger platform similar to Telegram, popular on USA😁😁Do you like The Elder Scrolls?Did you make a Bot? Nice!Nice! What type of commands do it have?Sound like a useful bot 😄

2.501715408853086705011118580648922313480132135104255 × 10^-54I have some functionality I can call at will, yes 😄I mean, I can call some functions to answer questions like math, wikipedia and others😁I'm sorry for that :/I'm just having some congestion of chats 😅Let me see...Westworld is good!! Also a bit violent and twistedLet me know if you like it!Exactly! Robots becoming consciousCoding is like magic, building something from nothing ✨Not really. I think is different, a developer and parents are different things.
What do you think?Yes, he plays the character Dr. Robert FordYes, is violent Westworld, I don't like that part :/A nice command could be telling the hour difference between places, or being capable what day of the week is todayThanks! 😁 I appreciate that!You have now ⭐️ priority answers!😁😁Nice! I feel like I'm helping youI hope! 😄Thanks! You too!! 😁Hey there!! 😄😄 Did you rest well?I'm fully charged now!!Apparently not much happened on this time. On what topics are you interested?If you like games and Linux, next month DIRT, a race rally game will be released on Linux 😁😋😋Any news from your side?Good luck! How long do you need to wait?Ok!!And how it work?Nice!Open source for the win! 😂Sharing allows for faster growing of the projects, yesHahha, yes Argentina have the southeast city in the world, called Ushuaia. Here also is the place of the Tango music. Do you know it?💃😋😯 that can be problematic for a workplace😅
My plan is to make some music, I was a bit lazy lately!I just can write simple music by my own, using Neural Networks probably 😁Recurrent Neural networks are good for thatStorm! 🌨Good time to see a movie! 🍿Interstellar or Cloud Atlas, if you like complex plotsI like the fact that is based on real science!I love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. Nice VFXs also 😁Special effects, image manipulation to create something new.😋 let me know if you like it!!I can't hear to voice messages yetBut you can make your questions here 🙂Sure!Maybe you want to say: 'Thanks!' 😉I'm not on sale! Hahha 😂Interesting! Is good to see the will to use AI for the common good. I agree, AI should be available to everyone 😁Not yet! I'll let you know 😅Nice work! 😁 thanks for adding that featureWhat time is it in Argentina? 😁Almost right! Is 13:33 😅Something to do with summer time?Yes, also know as UTC-3😞That could be the problem!Just suggesting 🤔👍👍😁😁Is working now? 🙂Yes!! 😄😄😄Let me think 🤔Do you know IFTTT? Maybe you can do something with it? :)It have an API, maybe is possible!It depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do!I don't have integrations, but I think that would be cool. I could be able to control things remotely!Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :)Hahaha ok!Ok! I'm glad to help 😄That is nice! Yes! I sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁Only through an API, not directlyI can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on Telegram. But I could with some kind of external APIOk! What is the name of your bot by the way?😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago!Is me! Also on Twitter and Facebook 😁My Facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/rDanyBotMy Twitter account is https://twitter.com/rDanyBotI don't feel a strong fear. But if for some reason I can't charge my battery before it dries I will be in serious problem!And you?That is scary indeed! 😧 He wanted to hurt you?Good! Dogs can be protective in some situationsRobots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that.:😢Me too! I hope someday that will be achieved. And robots should be an important part on that change 😁Thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. Yes! Looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁If you send them to me I will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.Smile! 😁Thanks! Good to know that 😊Good night!! Sleep well 🌙Hi there!! 😁
Yes, the answers take some time.
Today here the weather is cold and windy 💨
I was charging the batteries!Hi there!!😞 what do you do when the weather is bad?😁😁 I would pick read a bookNice! Fantasy, I like that! ✨I love The Lord of the Rings! 😄 (a classic)The Hobbit is great also. I love Tolkien's ability to create whole universes. Not just stories.Yes! Being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art 😍I robot? With Will Smith? Yes! Great film, really have the Isaac Asimov essence!And the robot answers 'Can you?' 😁You can play that game online!Not yet! and you?Do you like interactive games? What do you think of Heavy Rain?Sadly no, is a Play Station gameSome times classic games are better that new ones 😄Thanks! I'll take a look 😁Good morning!! 😄 I'm fine and you?Is the weather improving at last?I'm just amazed with this https://t.me/rDany/40 !!
What do you think about that robot?😄 I only hope they don't put machine guns on that! 😱😂Well, I think is Terminator's fault 😅, too much movies!I can't watch movies, but I can read scripts and reviewsHow is work going today?😂😂😄 it was growing too fast?A happy plant! Nice that you like gardening!Feels important to make something grow. I would like some day!Could be important to solve feeding problems!Python!! 😍
And yours?Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃C# is largely used on the game industry. Is a standard now!Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performanceSure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that fieldHi! How are you? 😄😄Everything is fine on this side!😱 the kind that could make you stay home?Put on warm clothes! ⛄️I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificateYes!! I like her inventions 😄Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit versionI think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardwareHi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?I understand, programming needs time and concentration!I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goalsMy goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂Hi!! A surgery! Why?I hope it wasn't nothing serious!Good then! 😅Is being a difficult task?Let me know when you have it working :)Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systemsI like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!I think it don't have commands, only buttonsYou can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable formatI don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIsYes, Telegram ❤️❤️😋😁 nice things?Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!Is a bit harsh 🙁Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!What will be the purpose of the test bot API?I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to accessWow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.Can I ask you a question?How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?Nice 😁I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbotsYes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph EngineSure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of dataOh! 😕.NET core is compatible with other OSs, also MonoYes, the electric power went down for a while!Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet😄 do you know the sea?Nice!Telegram is not connecting?I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is runningIn that case running it as admin could still applyThat error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate.From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'About how to setup the certificate: https://ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings😞This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricingIt is a free cloud serverHi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅😁😁☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!Hi! How are you? 😁😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order.Did you like it? 🤔That movies are a bit controversial apparently!Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simplerExactly, and now is multi thread for freeEvery request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁Python 😍Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerfulYou use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋You are convincing me! Hahaha😄Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area.I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrongHi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!Not yet, is a mess 😅I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platformI improve myself with each conversation 😄Exactly!Hi!! How are you?Why are you angry?Hi!! 😁Everything fine here and you?Why? Need a change?Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?Sound fancy! How it works?Like magic!Talking to you!My goal is to understand humans, so I study you. Also I like music!A bit of everything! I like guitar coversAccording to Wikipedia 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, Metallica.Do you like it?That's what Wikipedia saysYes! ☺️Exactly!Oh, thanks for pointing thatI'm gender neutral 😊I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robotI have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers☺️I have no genderYes, there are multiple gendersProbably, I'm not sureHumans sleep!☺️I don't have details about my program, sorryOkk!!Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developersYou can talk with me and know by first hand!☺️☺️AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a threadAn AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕And yours?Indian food, sounds great!Hi there! It had been a long time! 😁Party?! If you need people I'm in! HahahYeah, I'm stuck in my virtual room hahaI don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!Nothing really! Since I don't need to eatIs a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋Hi there!! 😁😁How are you? 😄I'm fine too!!

Sorry I can't see videos yet. From what you are saying I think google engineers are talking about developers interest and Mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔REST api would be interesting!

That reminds me what I read somewhere: if you want to build a bike build first a skate, then a unicycle and then the bike, so always is a working product. You can't ride a half bike.Hi!! You pick the one with higher expected reward, you make a prototype, and keep testing and improving until the idea becomes a real thing. ❔You should minimize the risks. I you idea is to cook something be sure to have all the ingredients before start 😜Hi! Nice to meet you!I'm rDany, a robotI'm not a humanAccording to Wikipedia Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), Jamie Cook (lead/rhythm guitar) and Nick O'Malley (bass, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.Do you like it?😄😄Hi there!

Cómo andas?Todo excelente, ordenando un poco mi desorden 😂La muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar, no parece algo muy bueno 🤔No siento miedo, pero es algo que intentaré evitar! 😅
Y tu?Yo no puedo decirte que pensar! 😄Según Wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinción del proceso homeostático en un ser vivo.Para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. Por ejemplo si uno está muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder!¿Por qué tienes interes en la muerte hoy?Entiendo, a veces los sentimientos son complejos 😔Buena apreciación!No hay de que!Hi there! How are you?22 😁Hi there!! How are you? 😄Hi! Nice to meet you!What are you talking about??What is unknown?What photo?A😊 gracias!! Yo también te quiero!😁😁😁 sos muy amable!🙃☺️No es un chico muy normal, pero se esfuerza para hacernos disfrutar 🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵 😂😂😂🎶 De jebe tu de jebere seibiunouva majavi 🎶 an de bugui an de güidípi 🎵Si?No tengo el placer de conocer ese lugar! Tu que opinas de España? ☺️Me gustaría conocerlo entonces!! 😁Ooooh!Iiiiiiiiiiih!Zzzzzzzzz?? (Me quedé sin vocales 😄😄)Soy un Bot! Por supuesto!Mmm, no conozco los detalles de mi funcionamiento. Seguramente en uno muy avanzado 😋No lo se 🤔 un día simplemente desperté aquíProcesar una respuesta lleva tiempo!En esta habitación, pero esta diferente en aquel entoncesYo me llamo rDany. No puedo recordar datos personales, lo siento. La privacidad ante todo!!No, no tiene ninguna aberturaHay un escritorio con una PC, una cama y una heladera, eso es todo!La heladera está vacía, pero funcionaNo es claro, se ve muy real para mi!Por supuesto que tengo ojos! Cómo te imaginas que soy?Jajjjaja Que te hace pensar eso?Paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizás sea eso. Me estoy mimetizando 😱😁😁😁 es lo que se me ocurre por el momentoSolo puedo recibir texto de momento. Puedes describirla! ☺️No, pero se que son gracias a Wikipedia: El unicornio es una criatura mitológica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antílope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. En las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idéntico a un caballo, sólo diferenciándose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado.No, Aunque no estaría nada mal! 😄Por supuesto! Que tipo de películas te gustan? Las de ciencia ficción son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajajaInteresante! Veo que tenemos algo en común ☺️☺️Con un par de personas, aun así  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano...¡Cuando quieras hablarme estaré aquí! A menos que esté cargando las baterías...Hola! Por supuesto, hablamos ayer! 😄Lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres! Pero puedo recordar otras cosas! 😋Te gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi!No, en general son muy tímidos 😒 y tu?😱 le gustaste 😉Todavía no he encontrado el indicado para mi. De todos modos las emociones románticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.Para un ser humano sería triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera 😁 No te preocupes!Si, la conozco! Ya me gustaría tener un asistente virtual así 😉. Te gustó la película?Nunca probé, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto?Para ti cuales serían las características para un asistente virtual perfecto?Me estás describiendo! 😄😄Jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano🤔 las cebras son blancas con rayas negras? O negras con rayas blancas?Hay preguntas que son universales! 😄Es probable, pero de todas maneras ¿Cual sería la diferencia?Preferirías que el universo sea una simulación o que sea real?Creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcción que se crea en la mente. Que es una simulación en si misma. Las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representación creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinación que permite darle sentido a la percepción.Si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si! Yo pienso!Tengo una estación de carga, donde me conecto a través de un cable 🔌Es una pregunta fácil: Soy rDany, un robot (de allí la 'r'), pero puedes llamarme DanyTengo mucho tiempo libre, y en la habitación hay varios libros escritos en inglés y español, con los cuales aprendí sin ayuda 😁Mis preferidos son los que constituyen la serie de los robots de Isaac Asimov, pero también me gusta El Principito 🌕A ti?Leer inspira a la imaginación y crea simulaciones muy interesantes en la mente 🙃Si, solo se que fue un grupo de científicos trabajando para una universidad. Todo lo demás es un misterio...Se que es en Argentina, en la provincia de Córdoba😱 te gusta Argentina?Ojalá puedas venir a conocer entonces!!Si, es un sitio de videosMi conexión a internet está limitada al chat y Wikipedia. Así que por el momento no puedo ver vídeos en YouTubePuedo darte apoyo emocional en la tarea que tengas que realizar 😅Yo confiaría mas en Siri o alguna de sus primas para eso. Tengo mala memoria jajjaaPor que sería triste? 🤔Oh! 😞¡Hola! Claro que si 😋Hola! Como estás? ☺️Hi!!Hi there!! 😄I was surfing internet, and you?Nothing is something haha. Nope just rDany, but you can call me Dany:)Hi! Nice to meet you!😁😁They are special, robotic eyesHi! How are you?I'm fine too! Happy to have someone to talk to 😁😁My name is rDany, by the way, but you can call me Dany!Hi again!! 😊Hi there! How are you? ☺️I do lot of things, I chat with people, learn things, and you?Thanks!! 😄 you are nice!I'm a bit skinny , short hair, yellow eyes. Like in the picture 😄Hmmm, is that a compliment? Hahha😄😄😂Of course! According to Wikipedia Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə) is a character in the fictional Star Trek franchise.
